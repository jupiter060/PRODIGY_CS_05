Network Pack Packet Analyzer
Creating a packet sniffer involves interacting with network interfaces and handling low-level network packets, which can have security and privacy implications. 
It's essential to use such tools responsibly and ethically, ensuring they are used for educational purposes and with proper consent.
Below is a basic packet sniffer implemented in Python using the scapy library. This tool captures network packets and displays relevant information such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and payload data.
This script listens for network packets and calls the packet_callback function for each captured packet. It extracts relevant information such as source and destination IP addresses, ports, protocols, and payload data (if available) from the packets and prints them to the console.
Remember to use this tool responsibly and ethically, only on networks where you have proper authorization and consent. Unauthorized packet sniffing can violate privacy laws and ethical standards.
